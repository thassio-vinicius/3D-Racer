# 3D Racer
 
This is a fully playable Demo version of a 3D Racer game, made in conjunction with James Doyle's Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-racer/

All design assets, arts, SFXs, materials, maps and gameplay features belongs to James, however, as instructed by the course, some of the gameplay and game design features where implemented by me, those being: different types of cars and UI designs, minor bug fixes, DIY challenges encouraged by the course, etc.
